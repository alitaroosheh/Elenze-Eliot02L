In this project, you could find 3 different schematics/PCB projects for a complete IoT-based Smart Plug.
The main section is ElemoW12S which means the module empowered by ESP12 wireless module and also secured by ATECC608 cryptographic coprocessor.
In this design, I've tried to expand digital IOs by means of PCF8574 and I've expanded analog inputs via 74HC4051.

The touch panel section is named Touch02 and empowered by the TS04 touch sensor.

You could find the AC/DC power converter, relays, and their drivers in the Base02 section.
